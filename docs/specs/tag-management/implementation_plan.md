# Implementation Plan: Tag-Based Discoverability Enhancement

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the Tag-Based Discoverability Enhancement feature as specified in the [feature specification](./spec.md).

## Overview

The implementation is broken down into 8 iterative steps that build upon each other, ensuring safe and testable progress while maintaining backward compatibility throughout the process.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Data Model Foundation

```
You are acting as a backend developer specializing in AWS Amplify Gen 2 and GraphQL schema design.
Your task is to create the foundational data models for the tag-based discoverability system.
To complete the task you must:
1. Create a new Tag model in the Amplify data schema with id, name, description, category, createdAt, and updatedAt fields
2. Create a LinkedTag join table model with linkedId and tagId fields to establish many-to-many relationships
3. Configure proper authorization rules for the Tag model (public read access, no mutations/subscriptions)
4. Configure proper authorization rules for the LinkedTag model (owner-based access for mutations)
5. Update the existing Prompt and ProjectRule models to maintain backward compatibility with existing tags arrays
6. Write comprehensive unit tests for the data model validation and authorization rules
7. Verify the implementation by running the unit tests and ensuring all tests pass

Your goal is to establish the foundational data structure that supports both the new tag-based relationships and maintains backward compatibility with existing tag arrays.

Constraints:
1. You must strictly adhere to the Amplify Gen 2 data modeling rules provided in the context
2. You must use tag names as IDs for the Tag model to ensure backward compatibility
3. You must disable mutations and subscriptions for the Tag model as specified
4. You must maintain the existing tags array fields in Prompt and ProjectRule models
5. You must follow the authorization patterns established in the existing codebase
6. You must write tests that verify both the new models and backward compatibility
7. You must not modify any existing UI components or server actions in this step
```

### Step 2: Tag Data Seeding

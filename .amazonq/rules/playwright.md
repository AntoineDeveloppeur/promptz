- Do run steps one by one using the tools provided by the Playwright MCP.
- Only after all steps are completed, emit a Playwright TypeScript test that uses @playwright/test based on message history
- Save generated test file in the e2e-tests directory
- Execute the test file and iterate until the test passes

## Current Status

The project is in an active development phase with core functionality implemented and working. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing the tag-based discoverability of prompts and project rules (Issue #93), with several new features planned to improve the platform's functionality and user experience.

The platform is usable in its current state, providing the essential functionality for users to create, discover, and share prompts and project rules for Amazon Q Developer. The team is now working on enhancing these core features and improving the overall user experience before expanding to more advanced capabilities.

Recent bug fixes have addressed issues with prompt deletion (Issue #94) and UI elements (Issue #96), while new features are being developed to support token calculation (Issue #102), context hooks (Issue #101), and prompt engineering frameworks (Issue #104).

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt

- Current tag implementation lacks efficient querying capabilities (being addressed in Issue #93)

### User Experience

- Search functionality could be more intuitive and powerful
- Navigation between related features could be improved
- Limited feedback on prompt effectiveness
- Tag-based browsing is limited (being addressed in Issue #93)
- Visibility toggle needs clearer explanation (Issue #98)

### Performance

- Some operations may slow down with larger datasets
- Search performance may degrade with complex queries
